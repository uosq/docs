# clientstate

The clientstate library is used to get information about the internal client state.

## Functions

### ForceFullUpdate()

Requests a full update from the server. This can lag the game a bit and should be used sparingly. It can even cause the game to crash if used incorrectly.

### GetClientSignonState()

Returns the current client signon state. This is useful for determining if the client is fully connected to the server.

### GetDeltaTick()

Returns the tick number of the last received tick.

### GetLastOutgoingCommand()

Returns the last outgoing command number.

### GetChokedCommands()

Returns the number of commands the client is currently choking.

### GetLastCommandAck()

Returns the last command acknowledged by the server.

### GetNetChannel()

Returns the [NetChannel](../Lua_Classes/NetChannel.md) object. This can be nil if the client is not connected to a server. NetChannel first spawns when a "client_connected" event is fired.

## Examples

``` lua title="Print the server's IP address"

local netChannel = clientstate.GetNetChannel()

if netChannel then
    print(netChannel:GetAddress())
end
```
