### GetByUserID( userID:integer )

### CreateEntityByName( className:string )

Creates a non-networkable entity by class name, returns entity. Keep in mind that YOU are responsible for its entire lifecycle and for releasing the entity later by calling [entity.Release](../Lua_Classes/Entity.md#Release). 

### CreateTempEntityByName( className:string )

Creates a non-networkable temporary entity of type [TempEntity](../Lua_Classes/TempEntity.md). You are responsible for calling [tempentity.Release](../Lua_Classes/TempEntity.md#Release) when you are done with the entity. To trigger the entity, call PostDataUpdate.

```lua title="What is my name?"
local me = entities.GetLocalPlayer()
local name = me:GetName()
print( name )
```

```lua title="Find all players"

for i = 1, entities.GetHighestEntityIndex() do -- index 1 is world entity
    local entity = entities.GetByIndex( i )
    if entity then
        print( i, entity:GetClass() )
    end
end
