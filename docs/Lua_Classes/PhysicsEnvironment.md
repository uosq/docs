# PhysicsEnvironment

PhysicsEnvironment is a class that represents a physics environment. It has its own gravity, air resistance, and collision rules. It contains physics objects that can be simulated in time.

## Methods

### SetGravity( gravity:Vector3 )

Sets the gravity of the physics environment.

### GetGravity()

Returns the gravity of the physics environment as a [Vector3](../../Lua_Classes/Vector3).

### SetAirDensity( airDensity:float )

Sets the air density of the physics environment.

### GetAirDensity()

Returns the air density of the physics environment.

### Simulate( deltaTime:float )

Simulates the physics environment in time by the given delta time.

### IsInSimulation()

Returns whether the physics environment is currently simulating.

### GetSimulationTime()

Returns the current simulation time of the physics environment.

### GetSimulationTimestep()

Returns the current simulation timestep of the physics environment.

### SetSimulationTimestep( timestep:float )

Sets the simulation timestep of the physics environment.

### GetActiveObjects()

Returns a table of all active physics objects in the physics environment, as [PhysicsObject](../../Lua_Classes/PhysicsObject) objects.

### ResetSimulationClock()

Resets the simulation clock of the physics environment.

### CreatePolyObject( collisionModel:PhysicsCollisionModel, surfacePropertyName:string, objectParams:PhysicsObjectParameters )

Creates a physics object from a collision model, surface property name, and physics object parameters. Returns a [PhysicsObject](../../Lua_Classes/PhysicsObject) object. Objects is created asleep, and must be woken up before simulation by calling [PhysicsObject:Wake()](../../Lua_Classes/PhysicsObject#Wake).

### DestroyObject( object:PhysicsObject )

Destroys a physics object.
