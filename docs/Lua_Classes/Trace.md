## Examples

```lua title="What am I looking at?"
local me = entities.GetLocalPlayer();
local source = me:GetAbsOrigin() + me:GetPropVector( "localdata", "m_vecViewOffset[0]" );
local destination = source + engine.GetViewAngles():Forward() * 1000;

local trace = engine.TraceLine( source, destination, MASK_SHOT_HULL );

if (trace.entity ~= nil) then
    print( "I am looking at " .. trace.entity:GetClass() );
    print( "Distance to entity: " .. trace.fraction * 1000 );
end
